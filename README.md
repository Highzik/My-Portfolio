This is the HTML-checkpoint
I basically did everything that I learned in HTML in this project.
I hope it can be reviewed and point out where I should work better on
I have all my CSS stylings done internally
I couldn't create a video folder because the video files are too heavy and they slowed down my laptop
I made changes in the index page by adding audios in the page, but I kept getting the message saying "there is a repositor working at the background" which made it difficult for me to commit my changes.
worked on the portfolio section but yet to get it completed.
I created a new container for styles. In it has a sub-containers holding different style section of the webpage
I am yet to complete the range part of the skill section in this job.
I have 2 sections of this job to be completed, i.e., the blog section and the skill section.
